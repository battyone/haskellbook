## Multiple Choice

1. `c`, a list whoe elements are all of the samet type
2. `a`, take a list of strings as an argument
3. `b`, returns an elemtns of type `a` from the list
4. `c`, takes a type argument and returns the first value

## Determine the type

See [`DetermineTheType.hs`](DetermineTheType.hs)

## Does it compile?

1. `wahoo` expression will not compile, bigNum is not a function at this point, it is fully reduced
2. all expressions are valid
3. last 2 fail, `Num a => a` is not a function
4. will not compile, `c` is not in scope

## Type variable or specific type constructor?

(TODO)
